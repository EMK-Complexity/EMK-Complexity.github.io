description:  ‘Artificial intelligence’ used to be about building and using algorithm based computers to solve problems normally regarded as requiring human intelligence. The influence of neuroscience has led to a new breed of ‘computational intelligence’ that exploits the complex dynamics of ‘neural nets’ and increases our understanding of the term ‘autonomous agent’. It has also raised the possibility that we might be able to understand more about how the human brain works and led to a greater ability to build robots that learn to adapt to novel environments. Igor Aleksander stressed the importance of depiction and planning in human learning and its relevance in understanding pathological conditions such as Parkinson’s disease. Inman Harvey described how ‘artificial evolution’ could give us the next generation of intelligent robots.
