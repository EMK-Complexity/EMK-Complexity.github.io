  Bill McKelvey - ENERGISING ORDER-CREATING NETWORKS OF DISTRIBUTED INTELLIGENCE - IMPROVING THE CORPORATE BRAIN

  ‘Human and social capital’ is the cornerstone of increasing corporate intelligence for generating ‘economic rents’. Complexity Science indicates that ‘adaptive tension’ dynamics (analogous to Bénard cell energy differentials) fosters an adaptively efficacious ‘distributive intelligence’. The optimal region for improving adaptive fitness occurs between the 1st and 2nd critical values of adaptive tension. This region sometimes known as ‘the edge of chaos’ is where emergent self-organisation occurs. Below the 1st value the is little change due to bureaucratic structures, above the 2nd the system becomes chaotic and dysfunctional.The job of the CEO is to encourage staff to be autonomous agents, but at the same time to define the ‘context’ of the business and to set the overall tension.
