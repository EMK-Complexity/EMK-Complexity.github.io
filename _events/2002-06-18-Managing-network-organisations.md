description:  Herman Roose charts the remodelling of 'Oranje', a social-profit organisation in the private sector which offers a service to the disabled in Flanders (Belgium). The problem was how to cope with a fast expanding service and at the same time utilise the new government regulatory framework in a beneficial way. What was needed was an organisational design that was robust and flexible at the same time. Implementing a networked design inspired by general systems theory, complexity theory and management experience was drastic but is currently successful.
