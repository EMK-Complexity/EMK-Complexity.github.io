category: Seminar
description: The 'New Economy' is making businesses both more complex and more volatile. Financial statements are supposed to give a realistic picture of what a company is up to, but such auditing as an exercise in representation is often simplistic. We need to ask whether the complexity of some businesses is getting beyond the reach of our present representation technologies and how this might be improved. Arthur Miller explores the use of visual metaphors in science and suggests possibilities for business organizations. Max Boisot explores the I-space and its relevance to complex learning organizations.
