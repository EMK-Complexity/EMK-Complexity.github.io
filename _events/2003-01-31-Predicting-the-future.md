title: "'Predicting the Future' with Dr Bernardo A Huberman"

category: Seminar
description: Job descriptions are poor indicators of useful knowledge that lies hidden among members of an organisation. Dr Bernardo Huberman shows us ways of identifying those who have knowledge relevant to particular problems, how to give them incentives to produce reliable answers and how those answers may be aggregated in a timely fashion. The mechanism includes a 'peer to peer' system that identifies experts, a novel privacy-preserving way of conducting surveys and a method for establishing sets of individuals with the same preferences without revealing what they are.
