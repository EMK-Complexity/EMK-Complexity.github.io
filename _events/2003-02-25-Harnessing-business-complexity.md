description: |
  Agent-based modelling (ABM) is a 'bottom up' approach to understanding business complexity. Unlike a mere process description, agent-based modelling captures emergent phenomena and provides a natural description which can include learning. It is scalable and flexible and will tell you where problems might occur and suggest ways of dealing with them when they do.

  Dr Bonabeau discusses some basic principles of agent-based simulation and how these are applied to 'real world' situations.
