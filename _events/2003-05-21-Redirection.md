description: |
    David Lane develops a theory about how agents act, or fail to act, during a process of innovation. He introduces the key concepts of 'ontological commitment' and 'ontological uncertainty' and he asks what we mean by 'uncertainty' and how we might classify the different kinds. He also examines the role of 'stories' in the decision making process.

    Enzo Badalotti traces the history of the Olivetti company from the multinational organisation of the 1980's and the subsequent separation into companies serving different market areas. He describes how the 'Office Products' division coped with radical change resulting in a new kind of management with different interaction patterns and information pathways.
