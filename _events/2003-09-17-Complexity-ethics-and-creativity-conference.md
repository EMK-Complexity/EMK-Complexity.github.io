  **Can businesses be more creative and ethical?** The first aim of any business is to survive - but can creative and ethical thinking actually improve their chances of survival?

  The **Complexity, Ethics and Creativity Conference** at the London School of Economics on 17 and 18 September 2003 aims to give businesses a new perspective on organisational development, based on complexity theory.

  This theory, which originated in the natural sciences by, among others, Nobel Prize winners Murray Gell Mann and Ilya Prigogine and developed by various academics over the last 40 years, is being used by organisations to create the conditions for innovation and creativity and to support an ethical triple bottom line. This approach stems from the idea that organisations themselves are complex natural organisms, adapting and co-evolving to survive within a constantly changing social ecosystem.

  The conference aims to bring together academics, artists and business people to explore and understand how complexity thinking can be applied in organisations to boost creative and ethical thinking.

  The **Complexity, Ethics and Creativity Conference** has two distinct but related foci. On 17th September the focus will be on **Ethics and Organisations** and this part has been organised jointly with the Instituto Tecnol√≥gico Estudios Superiores de Monterrey, Mexico. On the 18th September the focus will shift to **Creativity** and this part has been organised jointly with the Complexity Society, UK. The hosts and main organisers are the Complexity Group at the London School of Economics and Political Science, UK.

  The Conference objective is to explore the concepts of ethics as related to organisations, and of creativity, innovation, creation of new order, art, etc within the context of social complex systems. Has the meaning of 'ethics', 'innovation' and 'creativity' changed by our understanding of complexity? Furthermore, the conference will seek to explore some fundamental theoretical developments on the nature of emergence and on the processes by which new order is created.
