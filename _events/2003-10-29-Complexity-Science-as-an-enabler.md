  EXYSTENCE is the European Complex Systems Network of Excellence, funded by the Future Emerging Technologies (FET) of the European Commission http://www.complexityscience.org. Membership is open to both academics and business members. The series of Seminars is organised by Professor Eve Mitleton-Kelly (E.Mitleton-Kelly@lse.ac.uk), Exystence Coordinator for Links with Industry and Government and Director, Complexity Research Programme, London School of Economics. The Bilbao Seminar was hosted by the Mondragon Cooperative Corporation and specifically by Ikerlan, MIK and SPRI.

  The Seminar will try to cover the recent interest that Complexity Science is showing in network structures and network dynamics, the evolution towards the study of networks in Complexity Science (D. Watts; A.L. Barabasi; R.V. Solé...), as well as the Network Paradigm as the underlying structural arrangement behind most of the new organizational alternatives that have emerged recently on New Organizational Forms (N. Nohria; W.W. Powell; M. Castells…).
