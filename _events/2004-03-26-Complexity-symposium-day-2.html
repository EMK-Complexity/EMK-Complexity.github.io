  <p>Co-Sponsored by the Santa Fe Institute, the European Commission, and the London School of Economics.</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.santafe.edu"><strong>The Santa Fe Institute</strong></a> is a private, non-profit, multidisciplinary research and education center, founded in 1984. Since its founding SFI has devoted itself to creating a new kind of scientific research community, pursuing emerging science. Operating as a small, visiting institution, SFI seeks to catalyze new collaborative, multidisciplinary projects that break down the barriers between the traditional disciplines, to spread its ideas and methodologies to other individuals and encourage the practical applications of its results.</p>

  <p><strong>EXYSTENCE</strong> is the <a href="http://www.complexityscience.org">European Complex Systems Network of Excellence</a>, funded by the Future Emerging Technologies (FET) of the European Commission. Membership is open to both academics and business members. The series of Seminars is organised by Professor Eve Mitleton-Kelly, Exystence Coordinator for Links with Industry and Government and Director, Complexity Research Programme, London School of Economics.</p>

- title: "Future Directions in Complexity Science at the Santa Fe Institute"
  presenters:
    - prefix: 
      name: Dr. Robert A. Eisenstein
      affiliation: President, Santa Fe Institute
  description: "During the last two decades, the essential role of complex interactions in science, government and business -- and in human interactions generally -- has become very widely appreciated. In parallel, the progress made in developing new analytical and computational tools has made possible some significant progress in many areas. In this talk Dr Eisenstein will outline some potential new directions for the scientific program at the Santa Fe Institute, and its connections to fundamental science, to understanding some aspects of human behavior, and to decisions regarding social policy. Prospects for international collaboration will be discussed as well."

- title: "What Did The Internet Ever Do For Us?"
  presenters:
    - prefix: 
      name: John S. Leggate
      affiliation: CBE, CIO, & Group Vice President, British Petroleum
  description: "John Leggate will speak on how BP, a world leader in the application of digital technology to business processes, has combined its approach to innovation and learning with the connectivity and greater speed of operation afforded by the Internet and related developments, to liberate the creative energy of its people and drive the corporation to new levels of capability and performance."

- title: "The Complexity, Unity and Simplicity of Living Systems"
  presenters:
    - prefix: 
      name: Dr. Geoffrey West
      affiliation: Distinguished Research Professor, Santa Fe Institute; Senior Fellow, Los Alamos National Laboratory
  description: "Dr. West will explore a quantitative conceptual framework for understanding many of the generic properties of living organisms from molecules and cells to ecosystems. The paradigm presented will be developed as a way of viewing many related phenomena and will include a discussion of the cardiovascular system, trees and plants, growth, aging and mortality, sleep, genome size, cities and corporate structures."

- title: "The Low Intelligence Approach to Economics: Simple Laws Relating Order Flow to Statistical Properties of Markets"
  presenters:
    - prefix: 
      name: Prof. J. Doyne Farmer
      affiliation: McKinsey Research Professor, Santa Fe Institute
  description: "While much of economics appropriately focuses on the strategic interactions of agents, there are some situations where this is dominated by other factors, such as market structure. Prof. Farmer will present a model of the continuous double auction based on zero-intelligence noise traders. This can be used to derive simple laws relating order flow to statistical properties of markets, such as volatility and the average bid-ask spread, that agree remarkably well with data from the London Stock Exchange. He will then discuss the effects of adding intelligence, simulating an ecology of arbitrage and exploring its effect on prices."

- title: "PART IV"
  presenters:
    - prefix: "Moderator: "
      name: Dr. Ralph Dum

- title: "Robot Cultures and Emergent Languages"
  presenters:
    - prefix: 
      name: Dr. Luc Steels
      affiliation: University of Brussels (VUB AI Lab) and Sony Computer Science Lab (Paris)
  description: |
    Dr Steels will talk about how the increasing complexity of robots, and the increasing complexity and open-endedness of information technology as experienced in the Web, pushes us to adopt mechanisms whereby communication is no longer pre-programmed but based on emergent conventions and ontologies. These mechanisms are directly inspired by complex systems research and are grounded in complex systems theory.

- title: "Where Does Wealth Come From? A Complexity Economics Perspective"
  presenters:
    - prefix: 
      name: Eric Beinhocker
      affiliation: Senior Advisor, McKinsey & Company, London, SFI Business Network
  description: "One of the most stunning empirical facts in economics is the explosive growth in worldwide wealth over the past 250 years, and the related growth in the complexity of the global economy. Conventional, particularly neoclassical, economic theories have a very difficult time explaining this pattern of growth. This talk will explore what complexity science might offer in explaining this puzzle; most notably perspectives from evolutionary theory, thermodynamics, and cognitive science."
