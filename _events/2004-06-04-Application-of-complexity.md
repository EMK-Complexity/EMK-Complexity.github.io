  How does Complexity Science work in practice? Does it have any relevance to organisations? The LSE Complexity Group has been working collaboratively with organisations since 1995 and has developed an integrated methodology underpinned by the sciences of complexity.

  The 4 June Seminar looked at the latest work done with Rolls-Royce Marine (RRM) and with the Modernisation Agency of the NHS (MA-NHS). Terry Stock Executive VP, HR of RRM and Caroline Corrigan Director, HR/Development of the MA-NHS presented the cases. Both were directly involved and experienced the difference that was made by using complexity thinking and the tools and methods of the integrated methodology. Prof. Eve Mitleton-Kelly put the two cases in context and  described the different qualitative and quantitative tools and methods employed.

  The day was interactive and allowed time for participants to discuss their own key issues or challenges. The seminar provided practical evidence as to how complexity can be used with rigour and relevance; and how it can make a difference to organisations moving through a merger/acquisition or major restructuring to co-create a new coherent, sustainable and innovative organisational form.
