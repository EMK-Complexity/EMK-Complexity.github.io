    Exystence Symposium in Turin on Art, Complexity and Technology in May 2005

    The Symposium has brought together scientists, artists, complexity scholars and those working with complexity and technology to explore the interaction and co-evolution of ideas and experiences in the three domains; a different use of technology should emerge through the language of representation and of the medium in representation.

    Please see the YouTube playlist for Turin for more details.

      Annie Luciani is a research engineer at the French Ministry of Culture. She received a degree in electrical engineering (ENSERG 1973) and a PhD in computer science (1984) at the INPG in Grenoble France. She is one of the founders (with Claude Cadoz and Jean-Loup Florens), of the French (ACROE-ICA) research group in Grenoble (France) in 1976. ACROE-ICA laboratory is a Computer Arts Laboratory that pioneered the design of force feedback devices in 1976 from scientific and artistic considerations in Computer Music and Computer Animation. Since 1999, she heads the ICA laboratory of INPG-France. She participated in the design of the Cordis-Anima language physically-based modeler-simulator (1976) using force-feedback to control in real-time, visual and sound simulations. She is in charge of the research and creation in computer graphics at the ACROE-ICA research Group. She is in charge of the use of physically-based computer models and haptic interaction in artistic creations and artistic schools (animation, choreography, music). She produced two artistic works: Esquisses and Memoires Vives.

      Abstract:

      In this talk we will examine the role of the dynamic coupling in the instrumental relation between humans and instruments in the generation of complex sensorial events as needed in Music, Dynamic Visual Arts and Choreography. Temporal Arts are those based on sensible temporal phenomena, as sounds or evolving visual phenomena. The term ‘instrument’ is usual in Music, in which it refers to the physical object that is necessary to produce the sound and which is played by the musician-instrumentalist. But more generally, all temporal arts, i.e. arts that are based on temporal evolution of sensible data, as Music, Dynamic Visual Arts (kinetics sculptures, animation), Choreography, needs necessarily a physical medium to be acted and then the concept of instrument can be generalized at all the dynamic arts, whatever the sense that is stimulated (hearing, seeing, touching). During the instrumental interaction (playing a cello, rubbing a surface to produce a striking sound, to mould a past, to bounce on the ground by hitting it, etc), the physical body of the instrumentalist and the instrument are closely dynamically coupled. In terms of interaction concepts, it corresponds to the case in which the physical object is within the hand or within the body itself. This situation of ‘prosthetic’ or ‘embodied’ instrument is very different from conventional computer-human interaction in which the user is immersed in the environment, whether in a landscape-like open loop interaction or is manipulating an object via an interaction metaphor with a stick or a mouse. Such situations are ‘open loop situations’ that are not able to provoke emergent complex state changes and transients in the produced sensible phenomena. Conversely, when we are playing cello, or are rubbing a glass with our finger, such complex coupling between the instrumentalist and the played object able to produce non predictable emergent changes: timbre changing, sticking, creaking, etc that are constitutive of the quality and the richness of the produced and perceived sounds. We can say that a musical instrumentalist is playing ‘with chaos’, trying to master it and that the listener is hearing this ‘subtle struggle’ with its success and its failure. Then musical instrumental situation (as well as the dance performance or the puppet manipulation in visual or theatre arts) is a representation of the complex relation between the instrumentalist and the world, through the produced sounds (resp. the visual evolving events). Consequently, the introduction of force feedback devices to interact physically with virtual objects and virtual instruments, has to be understood not only in allowing humans to perceive ‘haptically’ the virtual object, - that is in fact a secondary issue - as usually considered today, but as a necessary component to produce complex auditory and visual sensible emergent events by means of closed-loop instrumental situation. The talk will be illustrated by several examples of computer representation of instrumental situation in music, dance and visual arts.
