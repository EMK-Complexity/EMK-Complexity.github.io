**Guest Speakers GS**

The guest speakers will discuss their topic and take questions for the first hour, the whole group will then discuss what has been presented using the principles of complexity, thus applying the theory to real world problems. The speakers have been invited to present not only real issues but also to expand the discussion beyond companies e.g. the evolution of coins in India and the regeneration of communities.

Philippa Foster-Back, 22 March, will discuss 'Business Ethics and Competitive Advantage' to explore some ethical issues, such as reputation management, faced by today's business leaders and bring us through a practical exercise.

Philip Yea, 23 March: ‘Creating clarity of vision in a fast changing market’

Philip Yea will talk about some of the approaches and techniques he adopts as the leader of a quoted private equity group with five business lines operating across 14 countries.

Dr Paul Stevens, 23 March: ‘The Evolution of the Coins of British India – A Complexity Perspective’

One aspect of organisational learning is the ability to generate new ideas. However, our education system tends to compartmentalise knowledge into predefined sets, pushing us into stovepipes from which it is very difficult to escape. One way in which new ideas might emerge, is by the application of the ideas from one discipline to solve the problems of another. This talk attempts to take knowledge from one area of learning (complexity science) and combine it with another, numismatics (the study of coins and coinage), to see what can be learnt from such a cross-disciplinary approach. The talk will illustrate how coins and coin designs used by the British East India Company emerged from the interaction of different groups of people learning from each other, and will raise the question of how this might be used by numismatists to bring a different perspective to their work.

Drs Wyatt & Dury, 27 March: ‘Innovation in communities – the conditions for change’

The aim of this presentation is to share our understanding of the process of transformational change which took place in an area of high deprivation in West Cornwall. Using complexity theory as the evidentiary framework we will show how an area characterised by isolation and despair has been transformed physically, economically and socially. Data has been collected through one-to-one interviews, non-participatory attendance of meetings, access to written documents and through field note observations and informal conversations. This presentation will draw upon our understanding gained about the creation of these enabling conditions producing transformational health, education, police and housing outcomes.

Lord David Curry, 28 March will talk about his experience of transforming organisations, both at Cass and Ofcom, and the lessons that were learnt from that.

STUDENTS THAT HAVE ATTENDED THE ENTIRE COURSE WILL BE AWARDED A CERTIFICATE OF ATTENDANCE

Papers

The students will be encouraged to use their case studies and findings to write conference papers. They will also be encouraged to write co-authored papers for publication.

**Course Content**

The overall aim of the course will be to enable researchers to understand complexity and network theory in the context of complex social systems, and to train them to use qualitative and quantitative tools and methods, underpinned by complexity theory.

The course is particularly relevant to:

(a) **PhD students** who wish to use complexity and network theory to analyse their field work, when working with complex social systems;

(b) **MSc students** **and other researchers** who wish to understand and use the theories.

(c) All researchers who wish to train in the use of in-depth interviewing and analysis and the use of **agent-based modelling techniques**.

(d) Researchers from industry who will find the course of particular relevance in addressing real-world problems.

**1\. Introduction to complexity theory**

Participants will be introduced to complexity theory in the context of complex social systems, using the principles of complexity developed by the LSE Complexity Research Group over a 12-year period working collaboratively with research partners in the private and public sectors to test and apply the theory to real-world problems.

[Ref: Mitleton-Kelly E. 2003 “Ten Principles of Complexity & Enabling Infrastructures" in “Complex Systems & Evolutionary Perspectives of Organisations: The Application of Complexity Theory to Organisations”, Ed by Mitleton-Kelly, Elsevier, ISBN 0-08-043957-8]

**2\. Qualitative methods**

Participants will be taught how to conduct semi-structured interviews, analyse the data from verbatim transcripts and present it back to the interviewees for validation at a facilitated Reflect-Back Workshop. The facilitated group analysis will use not only common themes, but also dilemmas, key questions and underlying assumptions, as well as the principles of complexity introduced earlier.

Many real-world problems appear intractable and are difficult to resolve. Part of the difficulty arises when only single causes are sought, when such problems arise from the interaction of multiple, underlying, inter-related causes. Similarly when an example of ‘good practice’ is found, there is a mistaken assumption that simple copying of what was done and how it was done, is adequate. But the results are often disappointing. Complexity theory would explain that, since the conditions are different when the ‘best practice’ is transferred, it is unlikely to work in the same way. A different approach would be to understand the multiple, underlying, inter-related principles (or causes) of why something worked well and what would have prevented it from working well. These underlying principles may then be used as insights to guide the adaptation of the successful experiment in a different context, by making it specific to the new organisational context.

The Complexity Group at the London School of Economics works with organisations in the private and public sectors, that have apparently intractable problems and has developed a method based on complexity theory, of identifying the multiple, underlying causes that together create the problem space or an enabling environment.

Two practical examples will be discussed. One was part of a project which attempted to understand how one organisation improved its alignment quite significantly. It will not offer any solutions, but it will illustrate some of the multiple, inter-related and co-evolving causes that together created an enabling environment which facilitated improved alignment. Making sense in an organisation is part of understanding the full context in which decisions are made; while mono-causal approaches offer impaired sense-making and thus tend to lead to ineffective decisions.

The other example was part of the ICoSS project, funded by the EPSRC, which looked at systems integration. Company EnF acquired an organisation made up of small firms that had already gone through a series of M&As (mergers and acquisitions) in a different but related market to its main operations. The parent company was primarily a UK organisation while the acquired company (AcqC) was distributed throughout Scandinavia. There were therefore apparently significant cultural differences and in the first two years after the merger these tended to overshadow other differences in business processes and procedures. At this point EnF joined the LSE Complexity Group project. The research findings showed that national cultural differences were not a significant issue, but other areas that impacted on the relationship with the AcqC did need more urgent attention.

Eighteen months into the project, the relationship between the parent and the AcqC had improved and the new company had increased its market share. The integration process in EnF was much more successful than in SSF, partly due to the recognition of a problem early on and an attempt to correctly identify and remedy the situation.

**Since these examples are with business organisations, guest speakers have been invited to talk about the application of the theory to other areas of social complexity.**

**Professor Mitleton-Kelly** will lead the introduction to complexity and the training on setting up, conducting and analysing interviews and presenting the findings. She has conducted over 500 interviews, has led 4 EPSRC projects, is a co-investigator in an ESRC project using the LSE method of analysis, and has trained several researchers. The students will also be guided on how to present findings to a business audience in an accessible way.

**Nazreen A. Subhan** will facilitate the day-long group analysis. She has facilitated similar group analyses with Rolls-Royce Marine in the ICoSS project, the LSE Challenges to Leadership Project, and the previous EPSRC training course.

**3\. Agent Based Modelling**

Dr Ugur Bilge will lecture on the use of ABM, and show different models in different contexts. Participants will have hands on experience on a number of web based ABM simulations. Participants will be helped to devise and complete a questionnaire for investigating informal social networks in the course. The data will be analysed by Dr Bilge, and will be shown back to the class for discussion.

A fuller outline of the ABM module is at Appendix 2.

**4\. Network Theory**

Professor Jeffrey Johnson from the Open University will discuss network theory and its applications to complex social systems. The basic structures of graphs and networks will be presented in an historical context. It will be shown that graph and network theory has been applied to human systems for many years, including social networks and transportation systems. The success and limitations of that research will be discussed. The part played by network connections in complex social systems will be discussed, including small world phenomena, and the use of computer simulation to investigate network dynamics. The ability of networks to represent social dynamics will be illustrated and discussed critically, in the context of modern ideas in complexity science. At the conclusion of the session students will be able to recognise some of the basic properties of networks, appreciate the historical development of network theory, and understand how network theory can be used to model human systems and their dynamics.

A fuller outline of the Networks in Complex Social Systems module is at Appendix 1.

**APPENDIX 1**

Networks in Complex Social Systems

**Jeffrey Johnson**

[1] Motivation for the Network Component

Networks are fundamental to understanding, designing, managing and controlling social systems. The fundamental defining feature of social systems are characterised by relationships between people. If we represent people by dots on a piece of paper, a line between two dots can show that they are linked by the relationship. Put together a lot of these links and you see a network. Networks are pictures, and most people find this a useful and natural way to see or think about the ‘web’ of relationships that characterise any particular social system. Networks are pictures are most people assimilate their meaning intuitively. Social scientists have be drawing network pictures for more than half a century. It can be argued that networks are a fundamental metaphor of human thought. As such they form a powerful method of representing social structures. Furthermore, social dynamics involves changes in network structures, such as the formation of coalitions and the breakdown of families. Networks underlie the social fabric of human systems at every level.

At the microlevel relationships between young girls are defined with exquisite precision, young men crave the respect relationship, and the rest us juggle complementary and competing relationships between us and our family members, pets, friends, neighbours, colleagues, and many others. At the mesolevel we are part of social structures with their own relationships: departments working with or fighting other departments and head office, SMEs (small and medium sized enterprises) providing complementary services, local authority units fighting for budget and passing the buck. At macrolevels multinational companies dance rings round disconnected government departments, while countries ‘posture’ as to ‘who will blink first’ in trade relations or possession of nuclear power (with its link to nuclear weapons).

While the many levels between micro and macro have their own inter-level network structures, there are also complicated intra-level network structures. Macro-level nations don’t blink, but their micro-level leaders do – subject to micro-level psychology which we like to see investigated in chilling films about Hitler or hilarious Strangelove portrayals. These examples show that social systems are characterised by hundreds if not thousands of relevant social networks. Any of them may be complicated, but together they can interact and evolve in unpredictable ways. Network theory provides a methodology for representing and analysing interaction-based complex systems, and formulating theories of their dynamics.

2] Objectives and Learning Outcomes

It will be assumed that students have no prior knowledge of network theory. The objectives of this component of the course are to

• introduce the concept of network, basic network structures, and network dynamics

• show the relationship between network theory and computer simulation

• collect data on and analyse students’ own networks

• abstract and analyse organisational network structures from interview data

• have students reflect on the application of network theory in their own research

• critically evaluate network theory as a contribution to scientific methodology

The learning outcomes of the course will be (i) the ability to define fundamental network structures, (ii) the ability to work simultaneously with many relationships of different types, (iii) the ability to discriminate between and be able to work with binary relations and relationships between many things, (iii) understanding the network-theoretic nature of multilevel systems and their intra- and inter-level dynamics, and the ability to work with multilevel systems (iv) the experience of analysing networks at different levels, (v) the ability to understand where network theory can be usefully applied, illustrated by whether or not network theory is appropriate for the student’s own research, (vi) knowing how to run a network-based simulation, and (vii) knowing where to find further information and literature of network theory.

[3] Outline of the course

The course will cover the usual network concepts including nodes, edges, paths, cliques, cuts, components, network flows. It will include references to recent ideas such as robustness, small world networks, scale-free degree distributions, preferential attachment. It will also consider systems of interacting heterogeneous networks and their multilevel dynamics. Students are expected to engage in hands-on activities, including data collection, analysis and interpretation.

[1] Using web-delivered teaching materials, students follow instructions to collect data on their own social networks, and submit it before the course begins.

**APPENDIX 2**

Agent Based Modelling

**Dr Ugur Bilge**

Introduction

Agent Based Modelling (ABM) is a relatively recent computer paradigm [1, 2, 3]. As opposed to classic computer simulations, the ABM approach is a “bottom-up” modelling technique, sometimes resulting in unexpected, so-called “emergent” behaviour. ABM applications model a medium to high number of independent agents such as shoppers in a supermarket [4] or workers in an organisation [5] for the investigation of overall system behaviour. Today ABM in the social context is often used together with Network Analysis techniques [6, 7] and network animation tools for visualising and simulating social agents in organisations.

EPSRC ICoSS Project [5] used the ABM approach to visualise social networks in an organisation, to investigate connectivity patterns and informal networks, to identify hubs and lynchpins as well as communications bottlenecks. The ABM module in ICoSS primarily focused on the “who knows who” question in an organisation.

Objectives

It will be assumed that students have no prior knowledge of ABM. The objectives of this component of the course are to:

• introduce, and demonstrate complexity with visual demos

• introduce the concept of ABM simulation environments

• provide hands-on experience of ABM

• demonstrate real world examples of ABM

• prepare a questionnaire to search for social networks in the course

EMK’s recent work has concentrated on the implications of the theories of complexity for organizations and specifically on strategy and policy development and on the creation of enabling environments to facilitate the reduction of problems associated with IT legacy systems (2 EPSRC awards under the SEBPC programme); on identifying initial requirements (EPSRC collaborative project with the aerospace industry); on organisational (e.g. post M&A) integration (EPSRC project under the Systems Integration Initiative); corporate governance (ESRC project with 4 other universities); sustainable development in communities, organizational learning, the emergence of new organizational forms, the ‘design’ of organizations, co-evolutionary sustainability, diversity, art and complexity. She has developed a theory of complex social systems and an integrated methodology using both qualitative and quantitative tools and methods. The theory is being used for teaching at universities around the world. She has edited a volume and written on complexity. Publications and the work of the LSE Complexity Group are at

[www.lse.ac.uk/complexity](http://www.lse.ac.uk/complexity)<span style="display:none">|</span>

Her first career between 1967-83, was with the British Civil Service in the Department of Trade and Industry, where she was involved in the formulation of policy and the negotiation of EU Directives.

Prof. Jeff Johnson is Professor of Complexity Science and Design at the Open University. Before this he was in the Department of Geography at Cambridge University and the Department of Mathematics at Essex University. He is a chartered engineer and chartered mathematician, and has extensive industrial experience. He has spent thirty years developing a theory of multilevel multidimensional hypernetworks for the design, management and control of complex socio-technical systems. This theory has been applied to many interaction networks, including city planning, very large road traffic networks, organisational structure and management, design, battlefield dynamics, machine vision, intelligent systems and robot communities. He is leader of the European ONCE-CS project (Open Network of Centres of Excellence in Complex Systems) and a member of the GIACS consortium (General Industrial Applications of Complex Systems). Professor Johnson believes that the science of complex systems must be advanced through applications across a wide spectrum of social, biological and natural sciences.

Dr Ugur Bilge has a PhD in Computer Science from University College London, where he worked in the early 90s as a research assistant in European research projects on Neural Nets and Genetic Algorithms. Later he worked as a consultant at the Logistics Innovation Centre, J. Sainsbury plc where he designed and developed state-of-the-art software tools for Forecasting, Optimisation, Planning and Scheduling applications for Finance, Retail and Logistics, applying techniques such as Neural Nets, Genetic Algorithms, Fuzzy Logic, and the Complex Adaptive Systems approach.

In 1998 he co-founded SimWorld Ltd in the UK, a consultancy and innovative solutions company, and developed SimStore, a realistic simulation of a supermarket layout with moving customers. Since then he has been developing Agent Based Simulations for a number of clients. Ugur Bilge was the Modelling Expert for the ICoSS Project at London School of Economics. He developed the Organisational Forms Simulator, a network visualisation and simulation tool for exploring informal social networks, and investigating patterns of connectivity within business organisations.

He is now Assistant Professor at the Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics, at Akdeniz University, in Antalya, Turkey, where he is involved in a number of research projects applying the Agent Based Modelling approach to social, medical and healthcare problems.

Nazreen A. Subhan is an Associate Researcher in the LSE Complexity Group contributing to the development of methodology and practice. Her earliest work includes: Experiencing Complexity Thinking in Practice – The Humberside TEC Story (Mitleton-Kelly and Subhan 2001). This was a multi-perspective narrative using the lens of complexity to ‘capture’ how this way of thinking and seeing the world changed how the TEC ‘managed’, designed and structured its organisation, creating new ways of working and relating. Nazreen has been the ‘in-house’ facilitator in the LSE Complexity Group of inter-organisational learning using complexity principles, incorporating the idea of multiple interacting co-evolving elements that influence each other via a collaborative action research approach.

Selected research from 1999 to date as part of the Complexity Group at LSE: research into Complexity Perspectives and Organisational Learning including complexity science in practice in organisations; leadership; IT legacy issues; trust, risk and creativity in inter-organisational relationships; enabling infrastructures in organisations. Recent research into the Integration of Complex Social Systems including the co-creation of new organisational forms. Organisations Nazreen has worked with during her research include: Humberside TEC, the UK Aerospace Industry, Shell, BT, NHS. She is currently part of an LSE team training the whole IT group at GlaxoSmithKline in applying complexity thinking in their work with the intention of improving relationships and relationship skills.

Nazreen also has a successful Change Agency Practice, begun in the late 1970s. She is currently developing her art through working on the themes of leadership and human purpose.
