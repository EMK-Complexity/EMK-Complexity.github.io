  This workshop will bring together three major leaders from industry and the public sector; will explore the inner skills necessary for leadership to be effective; and will present some findings from a recent LSE project on the Challenges to Leadership in the 21st Century, using an innovative approach based on complexity theory. 

  Lord Currie, Chairman of OFCOM, Keith Butler-Wheelhouse (recently retired) CEO of Smiths Group plc and Dr Paul Stevens, (also recently retired) VP of IT at GlaxoSmithKline, will speak on leadership in three different contexts. Prof Eve Mitleton-Kelly, Director of the LSE Complexity Group will report on the findings from the LSE Leadership project, which included interviews with fifteen FTSE 100 CEOs, Chairmen and Senior Civil Servants. What emerged was not just identification of some key challenges, but also some deep insights on how to be a better leader. 

  Participants from business, industry and government will also be able to raise their own challenges to leadership and discuss them with the speakers. Leaders and aspiring leaders are invited to attend. Places are limited and early registration is advised.
