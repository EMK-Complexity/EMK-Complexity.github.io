    Applied Complexity Theory as the New Framework for Public Policy.

    Organised by the LSE Complexity Research Programme & Department of Politics and International Relations, Lancaster University.

    For decades, international relations experts and practitioners have recognised the growing interdependence, connectedness and complexity of the global environment. Despite this, and a variety of intellectual challengers, realism with its simple and parsimonious tools based on a traditional scientific Newtonian paradigm remains the dominate framework in international relations and policy. The Complexity approach, emerging out of the physical and natural sciences in the late 20th century, can provide both a new, more realistic, paradigm and a range of simple and commonsensical tools (both metaphorical and modelling based) that can help move academics and practitioners beyond the limits of the current debates. In this workshop we will bring together a range of younger and established academics to explore the potential and practicality of integrating the new 'science' of complexity into the international arena.
