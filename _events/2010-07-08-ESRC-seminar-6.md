title:  "ESRC complexity seminar 6: Post 7/7 and 9/11: What lessons have been learnt on evacuating, following a major disaster? What can state of the art modelling, simulations and a complexity theory approach contribute to policy?"
category: ESRC complexity seminar series
project: SOCIONICAL
youtube_playlist: PLFWENpxYsbNpsMMf4ChgOQnKJhKpG16l9
venue: LSE
description: |
    The seminar aims to bring together policy makers, first responders and academics. Disasters happen, but can fatalities be reduced through the use of technology and better information to enable evacuees to make life-saving decisions? We cannot set up experiments with real disasters, but we can simulate them on a computer to study evacuation dynamics. The seminar speakers will discuss how first responders deal with such emergencies in practice and how academics model and simulate these disasters. Can these state of the art models help save lives? How can a complexity theory approach help policy makers?

    The Cabinet Office, Home Office, Police, Emergency Services, London Underground and other relevant bodies will be involved as speakers and participants.

    This ESRC Complexity seminar is held in conjunction with the FP7 European project [SOCIONICAL](/projects/socionical.html).
