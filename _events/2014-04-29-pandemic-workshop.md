    Professor Eve Mitleton-Kelly (LSE), together with Dr Randolph Kent (KCL) and Nick Wildegoose (Zurich) have organised a 3rd workshop on pandemics as part of the World Economic Forum Global Agenda Councils on Complex Systems and Catastrophic Risks. Deutsche Bank will be hosting the workshop. This is for information only as the workshop is now fully booked.

    Pandemics caused by Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenzas (HPAIs) can trigger global social and economic disruption.  Such events are unpredictable and can  place great stress on national health systems. Pandemics can cause high levels of absenteeism which can threaten business operations and disrupt supply chains.   But pandemic propagation is poorly understood, a better knowledge about HPAIs and how they can spread is essential to anticipating key stresses across a multiple of dimensions.  Only then can we begin to properly plan a successful coordination response across the public and private sectors. 

    Deutsche Bank in conjunction with Kings College London, London School of Economics and World Economic Forum Global Agenda Councils on Catastrophic Risks and Complex Systems will be conducting a ‘Pandemic Workshop’ to be hosted on Tuesday 29th April 2014 at Deutsche Bank in London.
