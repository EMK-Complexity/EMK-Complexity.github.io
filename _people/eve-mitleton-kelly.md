### Academic work

EMK’s academic work has concentrated on the implications of the theories of complexity for organizations and specifically on strategy and policy development and on the creation of enabling environments to address apparently intractable problems in business and the public sector. She has led, and participated in, projects addressing practical problems using complexity theory, funded by the EPSRC, ESRC, AHRC, the European Commission, business and government, including: alignment between IT and the rest of the business; the reduction of problems associated with IT legacy systems; lack of organisational (e.g. post M&A) integration (one of the largest EPSRC-funded projects (pre-FEC) awarded to the LSE with many business partners); project governance of a national project delivered locally by multiple partners (RBL); a governance framework for government using complexity theory; leadership in the NHS, Defra, and many other organisations in the private and public sectors; sustainable development in communities, organizational learning, the emergence of new organizational forms, the ‘design’ of organizations, co-evolutionary sustainability, innovation in the private and public sector, diversity, art & complexity, disaster risk reduction in West African States, energy & climate change; relationship between policy and outcomes (HSE). She has developed a theory of complex social systems and an integrated methodology to address complex social problems, using both qualitative and quantitative tools and methods. The theory is being used for teaching at universities around the world, including at an EPSRC-funded short course at LSE jointly with the OU, to train researchers.

The EMK Methodology to address complex social problems is currently being used with a Government Agency in Indonesia to address deforestation. The Catastrophic Risks and the Complexity Global Agenda Councils, within the World Economic Forum, are also using the methodology in a series of workshops with world experts, to look at the spread of pandemics.

### Publications

She has edited, co-edited and co-authored five books and has written extensively on the theory and application of complexity. Edward Elgar Publishers have also commissioned her to act as Editor of a Handbook on Complexity Science Research Methods.
