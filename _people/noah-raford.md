He is the former North American Director for Space Syntax Limited, a Fellow at the LSE Complexity Programme, a fellow at the Bartlett School of Architecture, University College London, and a research associate at the Oxford University Institute for Science, Innovation and Society.

Noah's research at the LSE focuses on the theoretical foundations of systemic change, with a particular emphasis on the impact of climate change on critical infrastructure systems. He uses scenario planning, systems mapping and web participation tools to help managers better understand the risks they face in a changing world, as well as what web-enabled complexity approaches can offer for new forms of management and strategy in turbulent times.
