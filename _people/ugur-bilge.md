Ugur Bilge is an Agent Based Simulations (ABS) expert, who develops tools for understanding, communicating and applying the Complex Systems approach to real world problems.

In 1993, Ugur received his PhD in Computer Science from University College London, where he worked as a research assistant in European funded research projects on Neural Nets and Genetic Algorithms. Later he worked as a consultant at the Logistics Innovation Centre, J. Sainsbury plc where he designed and developed state-of-the-art software tools for Forecasting, Optimisation, Planning and Scheduling applications for Finance, Retail and Logistics, applying techniques such as Neural Nets, Genetic Algorithms, Fuzzy Logic, and the Complex Adaptive Systems approach.

In 1998 Ugur co-founded SimWorld Ltd in the UK, a consultancy and innovative solutions company, and developed SimStore, a realistic simulation of a supermarket layout with moving customers. Since then he has been developing ABS for a number of clients, including a geographic model of Container Transport in the UK, and a coarse grain simulation of Oil World. Ugur was the modelling expert for the ICoSS Project at London School of Economics (LSE). He developed the Organisational Forms Simulator, an agent based network simulation and visualisation tool for exploring informal social networks, and investigating patterns of connectivity within business organisations.

Since 2003, Ugur has held the position of Assistant Professor at the Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics at Akdeniz University, in Antalya, Turkey. He taught Agent Based Simulations and Complex Systems, Artificial Intelligence and Data Mining, and applied complexity thinking to medical and healthcare problems, such as the development of a simulator for management of COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease).

In 2006 and 2007 he was a tutor for the LSE Taught Course for Researchers on Complexity Science and Complex Social Systems.
