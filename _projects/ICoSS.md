A 3-year EPSRC-funded collaborative research project working with BT, Norwich Union Life and Rolls-Royce Marine, which started in September 2001.

AIM: To co-create, with our business partners an enabling environment to facilitate integration and the emergence of a new organisational form.

By identifying the social, cultural, technical (as well as political and economic) conditions that facilitate the emergence of new ways of organising and new organisational forms. The ICoSS Project is using the principles of complexity as the underpinning theoretical framework. <!--break-->

Funded under the EPSRC (Engineering and Physical Science Research Council) Systems Integration Initiative programme, the ICOSS research project studied:

* the integration of national, business, cultural, and technical systems in the emergent organisational forms;
* the role of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in facilitating connectivity and the exchange of 'knowledge';
* the tension between globalisation and local cultures and requirements.

The project has been awarded the highest EPSRC grant the LSE has received and the examining Panel rated it first in its list of project priorities.


## OBJECTIVES

1.  To identify and articulate the conditions that enable and inhibit the creation and sustainability of new organisational forms, able to co-evolve with a changing environment, thus reducing the need for constant restructuring.
2.  To co-create with our Business partners, company-specific frameworks of enabling infrastructures (cultural, social and technical conditions that facilitate 'x').
3.  To encapsulate the results in generic frameworks, analytic tools, diagrams and supporting computer-based models.
4.  To explore processes for the sharing of knowledge within the Business partners.
5.  To continue developing a theory of complex social systems, while testing it in practice.
6.  To build a comprehensive methodology based on the logic and the principles of complexity, using both qualitative and quantitative methods and tools.
7.  To contribute to a business language that allows line managers to use complexity concepts in practical contexts.


## OUTLINE

The project will use a combined approach based on collaborative action research involving 'natural experiments'.

Natural experiments are new ways of working and relating being explored by the organisation itself. They are different from the dominant culture and 'emergent' in the sense that they are not pre-designed or imposed top-down, but are exploratory and bottom-up.

The methodology uses both conventional practice studies such as case studies, interviews and opinion surveys for evaluation, as well as exploring and developing new methods and tools, such as agent-based models, art and visual facilitation, conceptual architectures, and email exchange mapping (NetMap). It is also exploring how qualitative and quantitative methods complement each other. It is using the logic of complexity to underpin the entire methodology as well as the principles of complexity as an analytic tool.

By taking part in the collaborative action research process, business partners should expect benefits to accrue in a continuous stream throughout the life of the project, not just at the end.

The project will provide practitioners with a new conceptual framework, while testing and refining the theory in practice.

A multi-disciplinary group of International Expert Advisors from academia and business are contributing different perspectives, knowledge and expertise

Knowledge is defined as the result of successful attempts to transfer expected effort in the future to effort spent in the present. The less effort remains to be spent in the future, the more knowledge is exhaustive and complete. It is shown that some efforts remain necessary in the future for accidental reasons, e.g. to correct mistakes, to estimate parameters, to act. Some efforts will also be required for fundamental reasons. They are needed to compensate as and when testing for exhaustiveness proves ineffective. It is argued that the need for such additional effort may be met by starting collectives as a form of pre-containment. Such collectives may include non-ordered experiences. They will maintain themselves by striving to serve as equivalents to knowledge. They help in two ways: they indicate what is needed to create which knowledge. The design of collectives serving as knowledge is linked to second order cybernetics.


### Research Officers

#### Urooj Quezon Amjad

![Urook Amjad]($IMG_PATH/urooj_icon.jpg)

Nationality: American

Date of birth: 10 May 1975

Contribution to the project: Interviewed and analyzed various management levels_ dynamics in private and public organizations in the following key research areas:complexity, organizational change, political knowledge management, strategy, post-merger integration. Maintained strong relationships with contacts in these organizations to ensure the quality and dissemination of the research. During the project work, I independently contributed to project planning in the forms of methodological design, data gathering and analysis, and writing of academic papers as products of the project. As part of a four-person research team, and peripheries of associates, in our group and the university, I extensively coordinated my work with colleagues from various backgrounds (e.g. management, social psychology, economics, physics). One example of the inter-disciplinary collaboration is the ABM modelling questionnaire. Public presentation of our findings and work in progress were presented to both academic and business audiences, therefore tailoring the work to the needs of particular audiences.

Any qualifications gained as a result of the project: Attended Flash MX website design course at Hoxton Bibliotech, London, approximately from September 2003--January 2004.

Subsequent employment: Continuation of PhD at SOAS.

Time spent on project: 2 yrs and 3 mos. (31 May 2002 -- 31 August 2004)


#### Sevasti-Melissa Nolas

![Sevasti-Melissa Nolas]($IMG_PATH/melissa_icon.jpg)

Sevasti-Melissa Nolas has been working with the Complexity Group, on the ICoSS project, since October 2002\. Melissa's background is in linguistics and social psychology. She does qualitative research in the areas of action research, new organizational forms and community development. She is interested in the use of multimedia technology for dissemination and group work. Melissa is doing her doctoral research in the Department of Social Psychology, LSE.

Contribution to the project: I supported the project in all aspects of the research process, from data collection & analysis to theory development and knowledge dissemination via conference presentations and journal publications, as well as relationship development with research partners and presentations at research seminars.

Aside from the general and expected support and contribution to the ICoSS project I was responsible for:

(a) proposing a feedback/evaluation dimension to the existing research design, and carrying out said evaluation. This evaluation was carried out with the research partner I had been working with and involved 14 semi-structured interviews with the group of managers who had participated in the collaborative action research with us. The evaluation was important for two reasons: firstly, it gave us a greater insight into the action research process from the point of view of the participating members and secondly, it allowed me to begin a theoretical exploration of some of the processes and implications involved in carrying out action research, processes and implications which often receive little, or no, attention (see Nolas (forthcoming-2005) 'Learning as support for organizational innovation: possibilities and limitations' in World Futures Journal: Special Issue on Complexity and Innovation).

(b) designing (with the contribution of my colleague Urooj Amjad) the questionnaire for the project's Agent Based Modelling. I subsequently took responsibility for commissioning and overseeing the design of the online survey, the administration of the online survey and the collection of responses to be forwarded to the project's Agent Based Modeller. This contribution was vital for providing the necessary information for building the ABM.

Any qualifications gained as a result of the project: no formal qualifications gained. During the second year of the project I registered on an MPhil/PhD programme in the Department of Social Psychology

Subsequent employment: Research Officer on a action research project in the Department of Social Psychology . Details

Complexity Node (C-Node) Goal: "This C-Node works from an action research approach. Therefore, from the academic towards practical perspective, we study how complexity, system thinking and network theory help us to understand, design and manage the dynamic organizational structures, the intra-inter organizational network relationships and their enabling frameworks. And, on the other hand, the C-Node uses these experiences as case studies, from a practical towards academic perspective, in order to extend these theories due to the feedback from real organizational practices."

### Ruben Bauer

D.Sc. (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, 2005)

Nationality: Brazilian

Date of birth: 24 July 1962

Contribution to the project: Paper "Organizations, Knowledge, Complexity" (submitted for publication). Authors: BAUER, Ruben, VALLE, Rogerio, MITLETON-KELLY, Eve. Abstract: In a recursive progression, this article pursues three themes: the ways in which external and internal complexities are addressed in organizations; the different kinds of knowledge and their relevance to organizations; and the validity of applying, in organizations, concepts originating in what is called complexity theory. It then outlines how to go beyond traditional organization theories, which are directed to resolving or reducing complexity, on an approach that both welcomes and benefits from it.

Any qualifications gained as a result of the project: The case study of my D.Sc. thesis was one of the ICoSS business partners, thus the project had been a crucial source for my doctorate program.

Subsequent employment: Ministry of Public Administration and Planning, Brazilian Government.

## ICoSS METHODOLOGY

Has a preparation stage and 3 phases.

Is using the principles of complexity to offer a new perspective on the creation and sustainability of new organisational forms, able to co-evolve with a changing environment, thus reducing the need for constant restructuring.

Is a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, approaches and tools,

Some have been developed and tested in Complexity Group projects, others are being adapted from existing methods and others are being designed and developed for the project using the 'logic' of complexity.

Phase 1 output: Identification, together our Business Partners, of the conditions that will facilitate an enabling environment.

Phase 2: Experimenting with enabling framework.

All partners will be supported by the Research team, Advisors and the other Business Partners.

Monthly telephone conferences and regular meetings will monitor progress and identify any problems.

A second set of interviews will focus on the implications and consequences of experimentation/ implementation.

Phase 3 (in parallel with Phase 2) will document the outputs and focus on dissemination and exploitation.

The teams will be supported throughout the 3-year project by:

*   in-company and inter-organisational meetings
*   workshops
*   Guidance & Advisory Group (GAG)
*   Dissemination & Exploitation Group
*   International team of Advisors

## OUTPUTS

1. Generic frameworks of social, cultural, technical (as well as political and economic) conditions, which enable the emergence of new organisational forms or new ways of organising.
2. Company-specific frameworks of enabling infrastructures based on the pilots.
3. A methodology for identifying and analysing these conditions, to include:
   * characteristics of success, and process and outcome measures
   * criteria of ‘fitness’ for the pilot
4. A well documented process of experimentation/implementation.
5. A communications plan for dissemination to the rest of the organisation.
6. Management handbook, to include 1-5 above and a lexicon of terms.
7. Diagnostic tools that enable any organisation to identify:
   a. the appropriateness and relevance of the ICOSS methodology to a given organisational challenge
   b. the ‘maturity’ or readiness of the different parts of the organisation and its extended enterprise
   c. where, when and how best to introduce the methodology – criteria for choosing pilots
8. An Executive Summary of the above
9. Educational tools including computer simulation models to experiment in a safe (i.e.simulated) environment.
10. A web-enabled knowledge-base, which could be imported into company intranets, introducing complexity thinking, summarising the research findings, and offering recommendations, implications, diagnostic tests.
11. Educational and promotional material for dissemination to the wider community
12. A language, concepts and a way of thinking more in tune with the new economy.
